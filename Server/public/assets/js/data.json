Built-in modules represent specific types of content most commonly used on websites, for example, news, blogs, forms, and so on.\nYou can see a list of all built-in modules under the Content tab:\nenlarge screenshot \nOnce you create news, an event, or other content item, it is stored in the Sitefinity project and other users can view, use, and edit this content.\nTo display content items on one or more pages of your website, you use widgets. Each content item has a widget that is used to display only that specific content item. For example, events are displayed on the website using the Events widget.\nFor more information about using widgets, see Widgets.\nAfter you create a content item and make it visible on the website through a widget, you can manage comments for that item or set specific permissions.\n\nIn addition to the standard Sitefinity built-in modules, you can create your own dynamic modules. To do this, you use the Module Builder. For more information, see Dynamic modules.\nRevision history\nBuilt-in modules have version history. As a result, you can view and compare different versions of a content item. Every time you edit a content item, a version of that content item is saved by the system.\nFor more information, see Revision history for content items.\nContent modules and multiple sites\nIn case you have multiple sites, before you create or view any content items, you must choose the site where you want to work. You do this using the selector in the upper-left corner of the page. Different sites can have different modules.\nEach site that uses the module has its own data provider. You can configure the provider to be shared with other sites as well.\nEach module can use more than one data provider. For example, the News module of site A can use news created with site A or site B. Therefore, creating content items for one site allows you to use these items in all other sites. If you have configured a module to use more than one provider, when opening the module, you can choose news from which provider to display. All available data providers are displayed in the toolbar of the page. \nFor more information, see Multisite: Manage multiple sites.\nURL generation for images, videos, documents, and files\nThe automatic generation of the URL for a file uses the following convention:\nhttp://\u003cmy site URL\u003e/\u003cX\u003e/\u003cthe URL name of the data source\u003e/\u003cthe URL name of the library\u003e/\u003cthe URL name of the document or file\u003e.\u003cthe file extension\u003e where X is docs for documents and files, images for images, and videos for videos.\n\n    The URL name of the data provider\n    The URL name of the default data provider is default-source.\n    You can change the URL name of the data provider in the following way:\n    \n        In the main menu, click Administration » Settings.\n        Click Advanced link.\n        In the tree on the left, click Libraries » Providers.\n        Select the provider whose URL you want to change and click Parameters » urlName.\n        In Value, enter the new URL.\n        If you enter “”, then the URL name of the data source is not included in the URL of the item.\n        Click Save changes and restart the application.\n        IMPORTANT: You must not change the provider URL name after you have uploaded items, because this can break the URLs of the already uploaded items.\n        NOTE: The documents from upgraded projects have URLs that are generated without the data provider name. They will still work and will use the default library provider for the system.\n    \n    \n    The URL name of the library\n    The URL name of the default library is default-document-library for documents, default-album for images, and default-video-library for videos.\n    The URL names of the other libraries are their names.\n    The URL name of the item\n    You can change the URL name of an item by editing its properties.\n    \n\n\n\n            \n        \n    \n"},{"Path":"http://172.30.240.96/web/overview-create-and-edit-content","Content":"\n    \n         Overview: Create and edit content Overview  Content authors have several options when to create and edit the actual content of a specific content item.   The text editor The text editor provides you with a simple and functional interface to write and format your text before you publish it online. Use the editor to enter and format text, tables, and more. You can also insert already created text, images, links, lists, and so on. In addition, you can create text in HTML mode.  Inline editing You can use the inline editing to edit and upload content to your website directly while browsing it. Using inline editing, you can see how the items you are editing look in the context of the website. Sitefinity Desktop Application This is a light-weight desktop client for Sitefinity. You use it to publish Sitefinity content from your desktop. You can also create and manage libraries and upload files. Sitefinity Desktop Application will follow the workflow that is active on your website.  Revision history of content You can create more than version of your content. Every time you edit a content item, a version of that content item is saved by the system.

You can create more than one library to store each specific media content type. In each library, you can see a list with all media files stored there, files' properties, translations, common actions, and where the files are stored. You can configure the way media files are ordered, or displayed in your library, for example, you may want to use custom thumbnails to display files. In addition, you can change the method by which items are uploaded into libraries. Libraries and storage Once created, a library can be moved together with all of its content to another library, by changing its parent library. In addition, you can change the blob storage provider of a library, which moves all items in a different storage. For example, an image library kept in the database can be moved to the cloud, or a library from one cloud account can be moved to another.  \n\n\n\n            \n        \n    \n"},{"Path":"http://172.30.240.96/web/overview-classify-your-content-using-taxonomies","Content":"\n    \n         Overview: Classify your content using taxonomies Using classifications, you can organize content items, such as news, events, and comments.  In Sitefinity, there are two types of classifications:  Simple list\n    Simple lists group content into a controlled set of categories. There is no relation between the classifications of the simple list. They are equal members of a single structure. Hierarchical list\n    By using this kind of classification, you can group content in hierarchy on more than one level. Relationship between a top level entry and a subentry in the hierarchy can mean group membership or refinement of the top classification by a particular characteristic or feature.\n     EXAMPLE: Dogs can be one tag and Cats can be another. Both Dogs and Cats are simple lists, meaning that all items tagged with Dogs are equal members of Dogs structure, there are no relationships between dogs. On the other hand, you can have a category Animals, which has subcategories Dogs and Cats. This means that all cats are Cats and all dogs are Dogs, but also all cats and dogs are Animals.   IMPORTANT: Classifications are shared across different sites. If you are using multiple sites, changing a classification on one site will change the classification on every other site that uses it.   \n    To view, create, edit, delete, and manage classifications, click Content » All classifications.\n    The system displays a list of the predefined classifications – tags and categories, together with all created custom classifications.   \n\n\n\n            \n        \n    \n"},{"Path":"http://172.30.240.96/web/overview-reuse-content","Content":"\n    \n         Overview: Reuse content Working with substantial amounts of content in many pages within a site or among many sites and that content having similar characteristics may prove hard to maintain. With Sitefinity, you can reuse content in another page or site or use a variation of the content instead of having to create the identical content all over from scratch. Thus, having lots of similar content and diverse channels where to push this content becomes easily manageable by reusing and re-purposing the content many times across multiple pages and sites.  Why reuse? By reusing content, you:  Reduce content creation time by eliminating duplicating effort Reduce maintenance time  Ensure content is consistent throughout your site or sites  Ensure layout is consistent throughout your site or sites Utilize same content in different locations Reuse variations of identical content Reuse content within a site  When reusing content within a site, you simply duplicate it, or copy it. The duplicated content can be either an exact copy with a different name or closely similar edited content.  Reuse content between sites When working in a multisite environment, you can share content or pages from a site to one or more other sites within your environment, that is, use the same content on many sites. You can connect Sitefinity to different data sources, so that you can pull content from multiple locations and mash it up in your pages and sites. This means that you can simultaneously pull content items (news, events, forms, templates, and others) from the current site’s default data source and from other sites’ data sources that are within your multisite environment. Thus, an item located in a data source can be shared among one or more sites. As a result, related, identical, and similar content is consistent and easily maintained.

For more information, contact sales@sitefinity.com. \nWith multisite management, you can configure different languages for different sites, you can assign permissions per site and per content source. The content of one site can be shared among the other sites. You have the ability to enable or disable, certain modules per site, thus every site can have its own configuration.          You can have different domains for different sites, such as www.mysite.de and www.mysite.pl or you can have sites as subfolders of another site, such as www.mysite.com/de and www.misite.com/pl. You can also have nested folders such as www.mysite.com/support/de. IMPORTANT: Since the multiple sites of your Sitefinity share the same database and configurations, we highly recommend synchronizing the release cycles of all of your Sitefinity sites. If you have multisite option in your license, you can manage all of your sites using the site selector in the upper-left corner of each page and the Sites page, which you open by expanding the selector and clicking Manage sites. If you have a single Sitefinity site and you want to move it to a multisite Sitefinity instance, see Migrate a single site to a multisite instance.

You can also add a navigation bar to let users know how long the form is and how close they are to completion. Users can navigate between the consecutive pages of the form.\n PREREQUISITES: Multipage forms are MVC forms. You must have Feather module installed in your project. When creating a form, you must choose MVC only mode.\nYou break up long forms using the Page break widget and add navigation with the Form navigation widget. You can group your questions according to your requirements by logical sections, number of questions per page, content, fields, types, and so on. Thus, the form looks neater, easier to fill out, and fits the screen. \nAt the end of each page, the Page break widget automatically includes a Next button and a Submit button on the last form page. You can also enable the Previous step option, so that users can navigate freely between form pages.\nMultipage forms are client-side functionality. The form is rendered on the client and a client-side script initializes the form pages. Thus, before the event of submitting the form, all form logic is completed on the client side only. As a result, any changes to the form are not saved unless the user submits the form.\n\n\n\n            \n        \n    \n"},{"Path":"http://172.30.240.96/web/extend-the-submit-button-functionality","Content":"\n    \n        Extend the submit button functionalityYou can configure the Submit button to allow users to navigate to the previous form page.\nNOTE: By default, navigating back to the previous page is not enabled.\nTo do this, open the designer of the Submit button widget.

With the page break, you separate the form logically into different parts (pages). You can check how your form looks like in Preview mode. \nHeader and footer\nWhen working with multipage forms, the form automatically displays two new layout placeholders: Common header and Common footer above and below the main placeholder, respectively. These placeholders set common header and footer to all pages of the multipage form.\nFor example, a common practice is to place a Form navigation widget in the Common header or the Common footer sections, so that the users can track the form completion.\nNOTE: If you decide to switch to a single page form, you can remove all Page break widgets. As a result, the Common header and the Common footer placeholders are removed and all widgets placed in them are automatically moved to the main form content placeholder.\nForm validation\nValidation of multipage forms is client-side. When users navigate forward from one page to the next, the current page is validated. Users cannot proceed to the next step, if the current step is not valid. For example, if there is a field, that is required and the user did not enter anything in the field, form validation mechanism does not allow the user to proceed to the next step.\nComplex multipage forms\nYou can also use multipage forms in more complex scenarios. For example, you can work with a multipage form with more than one Submit buttons and with multiple required fields. You can add a button that enables submition of the form when the user fills out just the required fields, without filling in the optional fields in the same step or in other steps.  \nFor example, you have a multipage form with three pages. The most important information is on the first page. Therefore, you can enable a Submit button on the first page. This way, you make sure that, even if the user does not fill out the rest of the pages, you will get the information that you need from the required fields on page one.\nNOTE: You cannot have required fields in a step after the first Submit button, but you can add as many Submit buttons as you need.\nClient-side events of multipage forms\nWhen a user navigates from one form page to the next, a form-page-changed event is fired for the form DOM element. \nThe event has the following parameters:\n\n    Index – the index of the current form page\n    previousIndex – the index of the previous form page \n\nTo subscribe to the form-page-changed event, use the following code:\n\n\nvar formContainer = $('[data-sf-role=\"form-container\"]')[0];\nvar formElement = $(formContainer);\nformElement.on(\"form-page-changed\", function (e, index, previousIndex) {\n                // Your code goes here\n            });\n\n\n\n\n            \n        \n    \n"},{"Path":"http://172.30.240.96/web/continuous-delivery-transfer-configurations-during-upgrade","Content":"\n    \n        Continuous delivery: Transfer configurations during upgradeWhen you upgrade your Sitefinity project on your local development machine, you can easily transfer the upgraded .config files to the next environments from the continuous delivery process.

Anything you want your page to do, you must do it with a widget. Widgets allow you to display the content you create and configure how you want your content displayed. Sitefinity comes with a set of built-in widgets, which can be directly used in the pages you create. Such widgets are, for example, the News, Image gallery, and Video gallery.  Widgets are controls which you drop on the page (in page content editing mode) and configure them to display already existing content. You can configure the widgets to display different part of content, by combining widgets and by tagging and classifying content.  Technically speaking, the concept for a Sitefinity widget is the same as the one for an ASP.NET control. Field and utility widgets There are special types of widgets that serve specific purposes. For example, field controls are used to read and write value from a single field. Utility widgets, on the other hand, are not part of a specific module and do not display content from the CMS in the frontend. They help administrators, designers, or developers to perform their jobs.  Set widget properties Widgets have properties that you set to widget the functionality of a widget. If you want to display blog post using the Blog posts widget, you need to tell the widget which blog to use, how many posts to display on one page, and how to display them.

The content you create using content modules is reusable, so other users can view, edit, and publish it. Content items are displayed on one or more pages of your website using widgets. Each content item has a widget that is used to display only that specific content item. When you publish a content item on your website, users can leave comments and rate it.

Тhey determine whether a user can execute an action with an item.  \nEach action can be granted (allowed) or denied to a specific user or role. In ASP.NET terminology, users and their roles are called Principal. \nPermissions in Sitefinity are inheritable. This enables you to make a permission assignment to a user or role once and have this permission applied to each of its child items. If you want to customize permissions of an inheriting child item, you must break the inheritance. This way, you can modify the child item's permissions. This behavior can reduce complexity and time needed for managing the security of the system.\n\nThe root object at the permissions inheritance hierarchy is Security Root, which is instantiated per provider.\n Permissions page You manage permissions on Permissions page. To open the Permissions page, in the main menu in the upper part on the screen, click Administration » Permissions. Allow and Deny Each permission has Deny and Allow values for a specific action. If neither the Allow, nor the Deny is set, the user is implicitly denied the permission. By default, no values are set for the Allow and for the Deny. The default behavior is to deny a permission, unless it is explicitly allowed. Explicit denial takes precedence over explicit grant on the same action. Explicit Deny always has precedence over implicit or explicit Allow, while implicit Deny does not have precedence over explicit Allow.  EXAMPLE: If a permission for a role is not set, by default, it is implicitly denied. However, if a user is assigned to a role and the same permission is explicitly allowed to the user, the user is granted this permission.  User permissions do not have precedence over role permissions.  EXAMPLE: If a role is explicitly denied a permission, a user that is assigned to the role will always be denied this permission, regardless of whether the same permission is explicitly granted to the user or not. if a regardless of whether it is applied to the role or the user. Hierarchy and inheritance \nDue to the hierarchical nature of Sitefinity's secured objects, permissions in Sitefinity implement a hierarchical structure of inheritance, referred to as granular permissions. \nAs an example, the following diagram depicts the inheritance chain implemented in the Module Builder's module structures:\n This is why, if a certain permission for a given user is not set in one role and explicitly set in another role, the permission is assigned to the user - the user inherits the Allow or Deny for this permission.  Another example of Sitefinity's hierarchical model can be seen in Sitefinity's structure of pages, as depicted in the following diagram. At the top of the hierarchy are the pages that serve as roots for the backend and for the frontend hierarchies. When multiple sites are managed by the multisite module, each site has its own frontend root page. Every top page in Sitefinity, either on the frontend or on the backend, inherits from its respective root page, each child page inherits from its parent page, and so on.    Break and restore permission inheritance  In order to modify the permissions of an item, which inherits permissions from a parent item, you must first break the permissions inheritance. This operation clones the inherited permission from the parent item to the inheriting item, which enables you to modify them locally. You do this by clicking the Break inheritance button on the permissions screen:  You can revert the broken permissions inheritance by clicking Inherit permissions from parent. Restoring permissions inheritance clears the customized permissions of the specified item and replace them again with the permissions of its parent:  Filter by View permissions  When you retrieve and display a collection of items, both on the frontend and the backend, for performance optimization, the system does not take into account the View action of each specific item. The setting that controls this behavior is Enable filtering queries by view permissions. When enabled, the view permissions are evaluated when fetching items collections. For more information, see Change filtering by View permissions. NOTE: Enabling filtering queries by View permissions is a performance costly operation. Implicit View permissions \nWhenever a user or a role is granted permissions on a secured item for any action different than View, they are also implicitly granted permissions to view it.\nEXAMPLE: If you have a permission to Create or Modify an item, you are also implicitly granted the permission to view it, even if the View permission is not explicitly granted to you. You will not be granted View permission, only if the View permission is explicitly denied to you. Control backend menu links \nThe View permission is assigned per item. This allows each user to access a module and its content, without necessarily having permissions to create, edit, or delete items. Individual permissions are required to control the structure of the backend menu per user.\nTo deny permissions to users and roles for accessing a module, navigate to Administration » Permissions and set permissions for the respective module on Access \u003cmodule name\u003e module.  For dynamic modules, navigate to Content » \u003cDynamic module name\u003e and click Permissions, set permissions for the module on View \u003cdynamic module name\u003e backend link.\n Permission sets For easier management and separation of actions per context, permissions are logically grouped into permission sets. For example, the View permission for a blog post is not the same View permission for comments on that post, but the blog post supports both View permission actions separately in two different permission sets. EXAMPLE: The General permission set consists of permissions for general CRUD operation actions, such as view, create, edit, delete, change owner and change permissions. The Pages permission set consists of actions specific for pages, such as Edit content, and Modify title and properties. Permissions of default roles Sitefinity has roles created by default, which have certain permissions assigned to them. For example, Authors, Editors, or Designers. You can delete these roles if you do not need them. To view the permissions assigned to each default role, in the main menu, click Administration » Roles.

This way, Sitefinity knows the URL of each item at any time, regardless of whether the item is published or saved as draft. This is called Canonical URL service. It makes possible for you to preview an item, as it will appear on the website, even before the item is published. Also, each item, at any time has one default page associated with it, therefore its URL is always known. Content items are displayed on pages using widgets. Each type of content item has one or more widgets used to display it. For example, events are displayed on the website using the Events widget. A page is associated with a content item when you drop the respective widget on the page.  EXAMPLE: You create three events, but you have no page where you have added the Events widget. These events do not have a default page, because they are not displayed anywhere on the site. You cannot preview the events, because Sitefinity does not know where they will be displayed. You cannot know their exact URL, because it depends on the page where they will be published.  When you create a page and add the Events widget on the page, this page automatically becomes the default page for the events that you have created. If you, however, configure this Events widget to display only one of the three created events, this page becomes default only for the event that it displays. For example, you can use categories to narrow the displayed events. If you create a second page, which also contains the Events widget, you can set manually, which is the default page for the events, using priorities. PREREQUISITES: Before you configure default pages for content items, you must configure canonical URLs service. For more information, see Administration: Enable and disable Canonical URLs service. Configuring the default pages You can configure default pages on content type level.  To view and configure the default pages for all content items of a particular type, perform the following:  Open the page for the content type. For example, open the Events page. In the lower-right corner of the page, click Pages where \u003cContent type name\u003e are published. For example, Pages where Events are published.  You can see a page, displaying all pages where the respective widget is dropped and configured to display the content type. For example, all pages that contain the Events widget.  To set the priority, click the Actions link of a page and use the Up or Down functions. The page on the top is the one with highest priority. The page with highest priority is the default page.  For example, if two pages are configured to display all events, the default page for all events is the page whit the higher priority. However, if you have two pages, of which one is configured to display only events from Sports category and the other – only events from Business category, the default page for events with Category set to Sports will be the first page and for the business events will have the second page, even if you have set the first page with higher priority.   NOTE: The default page for a content item is the page with the highest priority, where this item is displayed. If there is a page with higher priority that has the respective widget, but is not configured to display the content item, it is not set as its default page. NOTE: If you have multiple sites, and the content items of one site are displayed on pages of another site, these pages also appear on the list of default pages for the items and you can set their priority. For more information about multiple sites and multiple data sources, see Create sites. For example, if you configure the provider for events of site A to be also the provider for the events in site B and you create a page that has the Events widget in site B and this widget is configured to display the events created in site A, when you go to site A and open the page with the list of default pages for events, the page from site B will also be present in the list and you can set it as page with highest priority. This way, an event from site A can open by default on a page from site B. Previewing an item and viewing its default pages You can preview an item in one of the following ways:  On the home page of the content type, click Actions link of the respective content item and then click View. When you are creating or editing a content item, in the toolbar, click Preview.  The item opens in its default page. If the item is not displayed anywhere on the site and does not have a default page, you cannot view or preview it. When you open an item for editing, you can view the pages where it appears by expanding Pages on the right. The page on the top of the list is the default page for the item.
